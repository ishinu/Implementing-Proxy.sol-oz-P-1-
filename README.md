# Ice-Cream Factory Sample Project 

Project is having two contracts :
- Implementation ( IceCreamFactory ) 
- Proxy ( FrontFace ) 

Our goal is to delegate all calls from Proxy to Implementation. [docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Proxy)

At moment, Implementation is working perfectly but Proxy is still having a few bugs. 

Soon it will be fixed and README will be updated. ~Stay tuned.
